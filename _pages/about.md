I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the [Universidad Politécnica de Madrid](https://www.etsisi.upm.es/)
in 2009, followed by a final project in biometrics and eye-tracking at the [Hochschule Ulm](https://www.thu.de/en). In 2011,
I earned my Master’s in Robot Systems Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision
from the [University of Southern Denmark](https://www.sdu.dk/en). This solid academic foundation laid the groundwork
for my passion for AI, which has been a consistent focus throughout my career.

With over 14 years of experience as a software engineer, I have worked across various sectors, particularly in the
aeronautics industry. Throughout my career, I have been involved in every stage of the software development lifecycle,
taking on roles such as developer, analyst, and subsystem manager. My responsibilities have extended beyond development
to managing suppliers, conducting on-site client engagements, and providing technical training. I have consistently
delivered high-quality solutions by leveraging my technical skills and leadership experience to ensure efficient and
effective project outcomes.


Currently, I am completing a PhD in Bioinformatics at the [AIWELL Group](https://aiwell.uoc.edu/), [UOC](https://www.uoc.edu),
where we collaborate with [Vall d'Hebron Research Institute](https://vhir.vallhebron.com/en) focusing on deep learning
for medical applications. My research centers on using retinal images to predict cardiovascular diseases, where I develop
and refine models combining classical architectures like VGG and ResNet with modern approaches like Vision Transformers.
I have extensive experience in the full machine learning pipeline—from data preprocessing and model training to
evaluation and result analysis—primarily using Python, PyTorch, and a range of related libraries. My work explores
cutting-edge techniques in image classification and multi-modal learning, bridging my academic expertise in AI with
practical applications in healthcare.
