Rubén G. Barriada is a PhD student at Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) and a member of AIWell group
(Artificial Intelligence for Human Well-being). He recived his Bachellor degree in Computer Science at
Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM) in 2009. He obtained his M.Sc. in Robot Systems Engineering, with specialization
in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision at University of Southern Denmark (SDU) in 2011. Currently he is doing
his PhD at part-time, combining his job as software engineer. His main research interests include computer vision,
machine learning and deep learning algorithms in medical image (retinal images).


I am a software engineer with over 14 years of experience, having worked across various technological sectors. Throughout
my career, I have been involved in every stage of the software development lifecycle, holding key roles such as developer,
analyst, and subsystem manager. I have also managed suppliers, provided training, and worked closely with clients
through on-site engagements, always aiming to deliver high-quality, efficient solutions.


Passionate about artificial intelligence, a field I have been academically involved in since the early stages of my
academic studies. My undergraduate final project was focused on biometrics, followed by a specialized master’s degree in artificial
intelligence and computer vision, where I completed a thesis on vision in mobile robotics. Currently, I am pursuing
a PhD, conducting research on deep learning models for predicting cardiovascular diseases using retinal images.
