I am a software engineer with extensive experience across the full software development lifecycle. My true
passion lies in artificial intelligence, a field I have been academically immersed in since the start of my career.
I am particularly interested in software development, data science, and machine learning applications in healthcare.
Currently, I am completing my PhD, conducting research on deep learning models for predicting cardiovascular diseases
using retinal images. My key strengths include critical and analytical thinking, a passion for continuous learning,
problem-solving, and effective communication. I thrive in collaborative, multidisciplinary environments
and enjoy working with diverse teams to tackle complex challenges.
 
This website showcases my professional and personal projects, along with publications and casual articles. Feel free to 
reach out for collaborations or questions via GitHub, LinkedIn, or email.
